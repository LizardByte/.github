# Community Rules

## Be Respectful

1. **Remember the human** - Be respectful to everyone and act professionally.
2. **Don't spam** - You will be kicked if you spam.
3. **Mention etiquette** - Don't mention other users unnecessarily. Especially don't mention (or DM) the developers or support staff. We read every single message.

## Communication Guidelines

4. **Use appropriate channels** - Please use the correct channel for your question and stay on topic within the channel.
5. **No cross-posting** - Cross posting among multiple communication mediums or channels is time-consuming for developers and moderators. Please be respectful of our time.
6. **Be patient** - Not everyone is available all the time. Someone will respond to you when they can.

## Before Asking for Help

7. **Read the documentation** - Your question may already be answered in the documentation. Also check the open issues. Documentation is specific to each project.
8. **Search first** - Search the channel before asking. Search open issues on GitHub, GitHub Discussions, and the Documentation.

## Support Requests

9. **Provide your logs** - Without logs we can't help. Please do not attach screenshots of terminal output.

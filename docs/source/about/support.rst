   in the appropriate channel.

GitHub
------
Our popular projects may also use GitHub Discussions for support. Post your questions in the appropriate category.

.. Warning:: We use GitHub issues exclusively for actionable bug reports. Low effort issues will be immediately closed.
   Spamming the GitHub repo or organization will result in a ban.

.. Note:: Issues will be marked as stale after a long period of inactivity, and automatically closed shortly after.

Social Communities

We will do our best to answer your questions on these social platforms. These platforms are best for simple questions or
discussing our projects with other users.
